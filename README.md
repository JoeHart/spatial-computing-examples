# Spatial Computing Examples
Collection of html/css/js examples of apple spatial computing stuff.

These are a collection of examples using Safari's new api's related to spatial computing and xrOS for the soon to be released Vision Pro.

To make the most of them you'll most likely need to be running a beta of iOS/iPadOS 17 or the latest beta of macOS.

- Model Element
  - To use these enable the `HTML <model> element` experimental flag in your safari settings on a beta os.
